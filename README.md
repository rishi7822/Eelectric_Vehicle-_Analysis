Electric Vehicle Population Analysis 
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Population Dataset from data.gov, focused primarily on EV registrations in  USA. The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of electric vehicle adoption, trends, and distribution using data exploration and visualization techniques.

Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted data types, and engineered new features (e.g., EV age).
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated key summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to gain insights into the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EV Age Distribution: Explored the distribution of electric vehicle age.
Top EV Makes & Models: Visualized trends of the most popular electric vehicle makes over time, including a word cloud for EV models.
Geographical Distribution: Visualized the concentration of electric vehicles by city and state.
Advanced Visualizations:
Pairwise Relationships: Correlation matrix and pair plots to investigate the relationships between features such as electric range, MSRP, and vehicle age.
EV Range & Type: Analyzed electric vehicle range by vehicle type using boxplots and scatterplots.
Price vs. Range Analysis: Scatterplot to investigate the relationship between base MSRP and electric range, segmented by vehicle type.
Tools & Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization.
WordCloud: Word cloud visualization of EV models.
Insights:
The analysis provides a deeper understanding of electric vehicle trends in Washington, such as:

The rise in popularity of certain EV manufacturers.
The range of vehicles and their relation to pricing.
Geographical patterns in EV adoption, focusing on urban areas within the state.
This project demonstrates practical data analysis techniques, meaningful visualizations, and can be a valuable reference for understanding the electric vehicle market trends in a specific region.
